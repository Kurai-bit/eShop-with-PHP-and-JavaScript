# eShop with PHP and JavaScript

## Description
This project consists of building a simple yet fully functional online store using PHP and JavaScript. The eShop allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and complete a purchase through a checkout page. The system must support two types of accounts: customers and sellers. Sellers will have access to a private area where they can upload products, including images, descriptions, prices, and stock quantities. Customers can register, log in, add products to their cart, and complete purchases.

This project is designed to simulate a basic e-commerce platform and will run entirely on a local machine using WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP). The backend is developed in PHP, and the frontend will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with optional use of frameworks like Bootstrap or jQuery).
We will also use Composer to manage PHP packages.
